El Fabuloso -> La Fabulosa
"The ground based footsies that Bearsus is known for!"
	-FA replaced with a hammer-fall type move, with long distance to let her close the gap easier
	-BA now moves further forward, to let her apply quicker pressure without the long endlag from FA
	-BA also has less landing lag, making it more spammable
	-FA1 now acts as a triumphant triple jump, before unceremoniously faceplanting into the ground
		-Faster vertical movement on both the rise and fall, but ZERO movement horizontally, so more of a utility than anything

El Poderoso -> Nothing lol
"He's just as good as I remember!"
	-Left all moves unaltered
		-This is to keep some baseline of how (un)balanced these characters are to the base game
		-I fully expect this modpack to be stronger than the main cast, so this is to test that theory

El Asombroso -> Shoto (WIP)
