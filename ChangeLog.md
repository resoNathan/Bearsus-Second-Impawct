## El Fabuloso -> La Fabulosa
### "The ground based footsies that Bearsus is known for!"
- FA replaced with a hammer-fall type move, with long distance to let her close the gap easier
- BA now moves further forward, to let her apply quicker pressure without the long endlag from FA
- BA also has less landing lag, making it more spammable
- FA1 now acts as a triumphant triple jump, before unceremoniously faceplanting into the ground
  - Faster vertical movement on both the rise and fall, but ZERO movement horizontally, so more of a utility than anything

## El Poderoso -> Nothing lol
### "He's just as good as I remember!"
- Left all moves unaltered
  - This is to keep some baseline of how (un)balanced these characters are to the base game
  - I fully expect this modpack to be stronger than the main cast, so this is to test that theory
  - If this theory is correct, then he will be buffed (or potentially nerfed) to keep him in line with the new cast

## El Asombroso -> Shoto (WIP)
### "This probably won't make it in!"
- Shotos are defined as having:
	1. A straight line projectile (will be replaced)
	2. An uppercut (literally already in the game)
	3. Some sort of spin and/or kick that usually moves you forward (the entire point of this game)

## ??? -> El Pollo (WIP)
### "wut?"
- Basically, I made a move so horrendous that I want to make a character out of it...
	- And it's gonna be a bear dressed as a chicken...
		- yeah...
